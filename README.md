Dask Working Notes
==================

A collection of working notes about [Dask](https://dask.org)


Build Locally
-------------

This blog uses Jekyll, which is built on Ruby.  You will need Ruby to build
locally.

Do this once on your machine (assuming you have `ruby` and `gem`, Ruby's
package manager)

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then do this from the root of this project directory whenever you want to
build-and-host your docs:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

That should also watch for changes and rebuild automatically.  Built pages live
in `_site/`.


Installing Jekyll
-----------------

As noted aboove, Jekyll can be installed as a [gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/):

> gem install jekyll bundle

Jekyll and ruby can also be install via conda-forge:

```
conda create -n dask-blog -c conda-forge ruby rb-jekyll rb-nokogiri rb-jekyll-commonmark-ghpages rb-commonmarker rb-bundler
conda activate dask-blog
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Add a new page
--------------

Content lives in `_posts` as individual markdown files.  These markdown files
have a few expectations on them.

1.  They should be named according to the date of publication like the
    following:

    ```
    YYYY-MM-DD-brief-title-url.md
    ```

    like

    ```
    2018-12-31-dask-in-the-new-year.md
    ```

2.  They should have the following front-matter

    ```
    ---
    layout: post
    title: Your Title
    author: Your Name
    tagline: an optional tagline
    tags: [A, list, of tags]
    theme: twitter
    ---

    {% include JB/setup %}
    ```

    You can copy-paste this from any existing post

3.  You can also optionally add the following element to the front-matter to
    avoid placing this article in the table of contents and on RSS feeds.

    ```
    draft: true
    ```

4.  Images should go in the `images/` directory and be referred to as
    `/images/my-image.svg` with normal HTML or markdown syntax like the
    following:

    ```html
    <img src="/images/my-image.svg">
    ```


Publish on Github Pages
-----------------------

Github runs Jekyll by default.  No additional work is needed for deployment,
just push to the `gh-pages` branch and things should be up in a few minutes.

The blog is also rebuilt nightly via a GitHub Actions cron job. This allows
post authors to set the post date in the future for publishing later. Jekyll
will only build posts dated in the past. This should make scheduling a little
easier.
