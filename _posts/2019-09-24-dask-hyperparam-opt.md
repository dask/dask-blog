[Dask]'s machine learning package, [Dask-ML] now implements Hyperband, an
advanced "hyperparameter optimization" algorithm that performs rather well.
This post will

* describe "hyperparameter optimization", a common problem in machine learning
* describe Hyperband's benefits and why it works
* show how to use Hyperband via example alongside performance comparisons

In this post, I'll walk through a practical example and highlight key portions
of the paper "[Better and faster hyperparameter optimization with Dask][scipy19]", which is also
summarized in a [~25 minute SciPy 2019 talk][scipy19talk].

## Problem

Machine learning requires data, an untrained model and "hyperparameters", parameters that are chosen before training begins that
help with cohesion between the model and data. The user needs to specify values
for these hyperparameters in order to use the model. A good example is
adapting ridge regression or LASSO to the amount of noise in the
data with the regularization parameter.[^alpha]

[^alpha]:Which amounts to choosing `alpha` in Scikit-learn's [Ridge](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) or [LASSO](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html)

Model performance strongly depends on the hyperparameters provided. A fairly complex example is with a particular
visualization tool, [t-SNE]. This tool requires (at least) three
hyperparameters and performance depends radically on the hyperparameters. In fact, the first section in "[How to Use t-SNE
Effectively][tsne-study]" is titled "Those hyperparameters really matter".


[^regularization]:Performance comparison: Scikit-learn's visualization of tuning a Support Vector Machine's (SVM) regularization parameter: [Scaling the regularization parameter for SVMs][sklearn-reg]

[sklearn-reg]:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_svm_scale_c.html
[t-SNE]:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html

Finding good values for these hyperparameters is critical and has an entire
Scikit-learn documentation page, "[Tuning the hyperparameters of an
estimator]." Briefly, finding decent values of hyperparameters
is difficult and requires guessing or searching.

[Tuning the hyperparameters of an estimator]:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html

**How can these hyperparameters be found quickly and efficiently with an
advanced task scheduler like Dask?** Parallelism will pose some challenges, but
the Dask architecture enables some advanced algorithms.

*Note: this post presumes knowledge of Dask basics. This material is covered in
Dask's documentation on [Why Dask?], a ~15 minute [video introduction to
Dask][yt-dask-intro], a [video introduction to Dask-ML][dask-ml-intro] and [a
blog post I wrote][dask-UW-cluster] on my first use of Dask.*

## Contributions

Dask-ML can quickly find high-performing hyperparameters. I will back this
claim with intuition and experimental evidence.

Specifically, this is because
Dask-ML now
implements an algorithm introduced by Li et. al. in "[Hyperband: A novel
bandit-based approach to hyperparameter optimization][hyperband-paper]".
Pairing of Dask and Hyperband enables some exciting new performance opportunities,
especially because Hyperband has a simple implementation and Dask is an
advanced task scheduler.[^first]

[hyperband-paper]:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf


[^first]:To the best of my knowledge, this is the first implementation of Hyperband with an advanced task scheduler
[^new]:It's been around since 2016... and some call that "old news."

[asha]:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05934.pdf

Let's go
through the basics of Hyperband then illustrate its use and performance with
an example.
This will highlight some key points of [the corresponding paper][scipy19].

## Hyperband basics

The motivation for Hyperband is to find high performing hyperparameters with minimal
training. Given this goal, it makes sense to spend more time training high
performing models – why waste more time training time a model if it's done poorly in the past?

One method to spend more time on high performing models is to initialize many
models, start training all of them, and then stop training low performing models
before training is finished. That's what Hyperband does. At the most basic
level, Hyperband is a (principled) early-stopping scheme for
[RandomizedSearchCV].

[RandomizedSearchCV]:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html

Deciding when to stop the training of models depends on how strongly
the training data effects the score. There are two extremes:

1. when only the training data matter
    * i.e., when the hyperparameters don't influence the score at all
2. when only the hyperparameters matter
    * i.e., when the training data don't influence the score at all

Hyperband balances these two extremes by sweeping over how frequently
models are stopped. This sweep allows a mathematical proof that Hyperband
will find the best model possible with minimal `partial_fit`
calls[^qual].

[^qual]:More accurately, Hyperband will find close to the best model possible with $N$ `partial_fit` calls in expected score with high probability, where "close" means "within log terms of the upper bound on score". For details, see Corollary 1 of the [corresponding paper][hyperband-paper] or Theorem 5 of [Hyperband's paper][hyperband-paper].

Hyperband has significant parallelism because it has two "embarrassingly
parallel" for-loops -- Dask can exploit this.  Hyperband has been implemented
in Dask, specifically in Dask's machine library Dask-ML.

How well does it perform? Let's illustrate via example. Some setup is required
before the performance comparison in *[Performance](#performance)*.

## Example

*Note: want to try `HyperbandSearchCV` out yourself? Dask has [an example use].
It can even be run in-browser!*

[an example use]:https://examples.dask.org/machine-learning/hyperparam-opt.html

I'll illustrate with a synthetic example. Let's build a dataset with 4 classes:

``` python
>>> from experiment import make_circles
>>> X, y = make_circles(n_classes=4, n_features=6, n_informative=2)
>>> scatter(X[:, :2], color=y)
```

[stsievert/dask-hyperband-comparison], or makes slight modifications.*

[stsievert/dask-hyperband-comparison]:https://github.com/stsievert/dask-hyperband-comparison

Let's build a fully connected neural net with 24 neurons for classification:

``` python
>>> from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
>>> model = MLPClassifier()
```

Building the neural net with PyTorch  is also possible[^skorch] (and what I used in development).

[^skorch]:through the Scikit-learn API wrapper [skorch]

This neural net's behavior is dictated by 6 hyperparameters. Only one controls
the model of the optimal architecture (`hidden_layer_sizes`, the number of
neurons in each layer). The rest control finding the best model of that
architecture. Details on the hyperparameters are in the
*[Appendix](#appendix)*.

``` python
>>> params = ...  # details in appendix
>>> params.keys()
dict_keys(['hidden_layer_sizes', 'alpha', 'batch_size', 'learning_rate'
           'learning_rate_init', 'power_t', 'momentum'])
>>> params["hidden_layer_sizes"]  # always 24 neurons
[(24, ), (12, 12), (6, 6, 6, 6), (4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4), (12, 6, 3, 3)]
```

I choose these hyperparameters to have a complex search space that mimics the
searches performed for most neural networks. These searches typically involve
hyperparameters like "dropout", "learning rate", "momentum" and "weight
decay".[^user-facing]
End users don't care hyperparameters like these; they don't change the
model architecture, only finding the best model of a particular architecture.

[^user-facing]:There's less tuning for adaptive step size methods like [Adam] or [Adagrad], but they might under-perform on the test data (see "[The Marginal Value of Adaptive Gradient Methods for Machine Learning][adamarginal]")

How can high performing hyperparameter values be found quickly?

## Finding the best parameters

First, let's look at the parameters required for Dask-ML's implementation
of Hyperband (which is in the class `HyperbandSearchCV`).

### Hyperband parameters: rule-of-thumb
`HyperbandSearchCV` has two inputs:

1. `max_iter`, which determines how many times to call `partial_fit`
2. the chunk size of the Dask array, which determines how many data each
   `partial_fit` call receives.

These fall out pretty naturally once it's known how long to train the best
model and very approximately how many parameters to sample:

``` python
n_examples = 50 * len(X_train)  # 50 passes through dataset for best model
n_params = 299  # sample about 300 parameters

# inputs to hyperband
max_iter = n_params
chunk_size = n_examples // n_params
```

The inputs to this rule-of-thumb are exactly what the user cares about:

* a measure of how complex the search space is (via `n_params`)
* how long to train the best model (via `n_examples`)

Notably, there's no tradeoff between `n_examples` and `n_params` like with
Scikit-learn's `RandomizedSearchCV` because `n_examples` is only for *some*
models, not for *all* models. There's more details on this
rule-of-thumb in the "Notes" section of the [`HyperbandSearchCV`
docs][hyperband-docstring].

[hyperband-docstring]:https://ml.dask.org/modules/generated/dask_ml.model_selection.HyperbandSearchCV.html#dask_ml.model_selection.HyperbandSearchCV

With these inputs a `HyperbandSearchCV` object can easily be created.

### Finding the best performing hyperparameters

This model selection algorithm Hyperband is implemented in the class
`HyperbandSearchCV`. Let's create an instance of that class:

``` python
>>> from dask_ml.model_selection import HyperbandSearchCV
>>>
>>> search = HyperbandSearchCV(
...     est, params, max_iter=max_iter, aggressiveness=4
... )
```

`aggressiveness` defaults to 3. `aggressiveness=4` is chosen because this is an
*initial* search; I know nothing about how this search space. Then, this search
should be more aggressive in culling off bad models.

Hyperband hides some details from the user (which enables the mathematical
guarantees), specifically the details on the amount of training and
the number of models created. These details are available in the `metadata`
attribute:

``` python
>>> search.metadata["n_models"]
378
>>> search.metadata["partial_fit_calls"]
5721
```

Now that we have some idea on how long the computation will take, let's ask it
to find the best set of hyperparameters:

``` python
>>> from dask_ml.model_selection import train_test_split
>>> X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
>>>
>>> X_train = X_train.rechunk(chunk_size)
>>> y_train = y_train.rechunk(chunk_size)
>>>
>>> search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The dashboard will be active during this time[^dashboard]:

[^dashboard]:But it probably won't be this fast: the video is sped up by a factor of 3.

</p>

How well do these hyperparameters perform?

``` python
>>> search.best_score_
0.9019221418447483
```

`HyperbandSearchCV` mirrors Scikit-learn's API for [RandomizedSearchCV], so it
has access to all the expected attributes and methods:

``` python
>>> search.best_params_
{"batch_size": 64, "hidden_layer_sizes": [6, 6, 6, 6], ...}
>>> search.score(X_test, y_test)
0.8989070100111217
>>> search.best_model_
MLPClassifier(...)
```

Details on the attributes and methods are in the [HyperbandSearchCV
documentation][hyperband-docs].

## Performance

<!--
Plot 1: how well does it do?
Plot 2: how does this scale?
Plot 3: what opportunities does Dask enable?
-->

I ran this 200 times on my personal laptop with 4 cores.
Let's look at the distribution of final validation scores:

<img src="/images/2019-hyperband/synthetic/final-acc.svg"
 width="400px"/>

The "passive" comparison is really `RandomizedSearchCV` configured so it takes
an equal amount of work as `HyperbandSearchCV`. Let's see how this does over
time:

<img src="/images/2019-hyperband/synthetic/val-acc.svg"
 width="400px"/>

This graph shows the mean score over the 200 runs with the solid line, and the
shaded region represents the [interquartile range]. The dotted green
line indicates the data required to train 4 models to completion.
"Passes through the dataset" is a good proxy
for "time to solution" because there are only 4 workers.

[interquartile range]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range

This graph shows that `HyperbandSearchCV` will find parameters at least 3 times
quicker than `RandomizedSearchCV`.

### Dask opportunities

What opportunities does combining Hyperband and Dask create?
`HyperbandSearchCV` has a lot of internal parallelism  and Dask is an advanced task
scheduler.

The most obvious opportunity involves job prioritization. Hyperband fits many
models in parallel and Dask might not have that
workers available. This means some jobs have to wait for other jobs
to finish. Of course, Dask can prioritize jobs[^prior] and choose which models
to fit first.

[^prior]:See Dask's documentation on [Prioritizing Work](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/priority.html)
[dask-prior]:https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/priority.html

Let's assign the priority for fitting a certain model to be the model's most
recent score. How does this prioritization scheme influence the score? Let's
compare the prioritization schemes in
a single run of the 200 above:

<img src="/images/2019-hyperband/synthetic/priority.svg"
     width="400px" />

These two lines are the same in every way except for
the prioritization scheme.
This graph compares the "high scores" prioritization scheme and the Dask's
default prioritization scheme ("fifo").

This graph is certainly helped by the fact that is run with only 4 workers.
Job priority does not matter if every job can be run right away (there's
nothing to assign priority too!).

### Amenability to parallelism

How does Hyperband scale with the number of workers?

I ran another separate experiment to measure. This experiment is described more in the [corresponding
paper][scipy19], but the relevant difference is that a [PyTorch] neural network is used
through [skorch] instead of Scikit-learn's MLPClassifier.

I ran the *same* experiment with a different number of Dask
workers.[^same] Here's how `HyperbandSearchCV` scales:

[skorch]:https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[PyTorch]:https://pytorch.org/

<img src="/images/2019-hyperband/image-denoising/scaling-patience.svg" width="400px"  />

Training one model to completion requires 243 seconds (which is marked by the
white line). This is a comparison with `patience`, which stops training models
if their scores aren't increasing enough. Functionally, this is very useful
because the user might accidentally specify `n_examples` to be too large.

It looks like the speedups start to saturate somewhere
between 16 and 24 workers, at least for this example.
Of course, `patience` doesn't work as well for a large number of
workers.[^scale-worker]

[^scale-worker]:There's no time benefit to stopping jobs early if there are infinite workers; there's never a queue of jobs waiting to be run
[^same]:Everything is the same between different runs: the hyperparameters sampled, the model's internal random state, the data passed for fitting. Only the number of workers varies.

## Future work

There's some ongoing pull requests to improve `HyperbandSearchCV`. The most
significant of these involves tweaking some Hyperband internals so `HyperbandSearchCV`
works better with initial or very exploratory searches ([dask/dask-ml #532]).

[dask/dask-ml #532]:https://github.com/dask/dask-ml/pull/532

The biggest improvement I see is treating *dataset size* as the scarce resource
that needs to be preserved instead of *training time*. This would allow
Hyperband to work with any model, instead of only models that implement
`partial_fit`.

Serialization is an important part of the distributed Hyperband implementation
in `HyperbandSearchCV`. Scikit-learn and PyTorch can easily handle this because
they support the Pickle protocol[^pickle-post], but
Keras/Tensorflow/MXNet present challenges. The use of `HyperbandSearchCV` could
be increased by resolving this issue.

## Appendix

I choose to tune 7 hyperparameters, which are

* `hidden_layer_sizes`, which controls the activation function used at each
  neuron
* `alpha`, which controls the amount of regularization

More hyperparameters control finding the best neural network:

* `batch_size`, which controls the number of examples the `optimizer` uses to
  approximate the gradient
* `learning_rate`, `learning_rate_init`, `power_t`, which control some basic
  hyperparameters for the SGD optimizer I'll be using
* `momentum`, a more advanced hyperparameter for SGD with Nesterov's momentum.
