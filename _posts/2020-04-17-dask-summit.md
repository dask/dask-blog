In late February members of the Dask community gathered together in Washington, DC.
This was a mix of open source project maintainers
and active users from a broad range of institutions.
This post shares a summary of what happened at this workshop,
including slides, images, and lessons learned.

*Note: this event happened just before the widespread effects of the COVID-19
outbreak in the US and Europe.  We were glad to see each other, but wouldn't recommend doing this today.*

Who came?
---------

This was an invite-only event of fifty people, with a cap of three people per
organization.  We intentionally invited an even mix of half people who
self-identified as open source maintainers, and half people who identified as
institutional users.  We had attendees from academia, small startups, tech
companies, government institutions, and large enterprise.  It was surprising
how much we all had in common.
We had attendees from the following companies:

-   Anaconda
-   Berkeley Institute for Datascience
-   Blue Yonder
-   Brookhaven National Lab
-   Capital One
-   Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
-   Coiled Computing
-   Columbia University
-   D. E. Shaw & Co.
-   Flatiron Health
-   Howard Hughes Medial Institute, Janelia Research Campus
-   Inria
-   Kitware
-   Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
-   Los Alamos National Laboratory
-   MetroStar Systems
-   Microsoft
-   NIMH
-   NVIDIA
-   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
-   National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center
-   Prefect
-   Quansight
-   Related Sciences
-   Saturn Cloud
-   Smithsonian Institution
-   SymphonyRM
-   The HDF Group
-   USGS
-   Ursa Labs


Objectives
----------

The Dask community comes from a broad range of backgrounds.  .
It's an odd bunch, all solving very different problems,
but all with a surprisingly common set of needs.
We've all known each other on GitHub for several years,
and have a long shared history, but many of us had never met in person.

In hindsight, this workshop served two main purposes:

1.  It helped us to see that we were all struggling with the same problems
    and so helped to form direction and motivate future work
2.  It helped us to create social bonds and collaborations that help us manage
    the day to day challenges of building and maintaining community software
    across organizations


Structure
---------

We met for three days.

On days 1-2 we started with quick talks from the attendees and followed with
afternoon working sessions.

Talks were short around 10-15 minutes
(having only experts in the room meant that we could easily skip the introductory material)
and always had the same structure:

1.  A brief description of the domain that they're in and why it's important

    *Example: We look at seismic readings from thousand of measurement devices around
    the world to understand and predict catastrophic earthquakes*

2.  How they use Dask to solve this problem

    *Example: this means that we need to cross-correlate thousands of very
    long timeseries.  We use Xarray on AWS with some custom operations.*

3.  What is wrong with Dask, and what they would like to see improved

    *Example: It turns out that our axes labels can grow larger than what
    Xarray was designed for.  Also, the task graph size for Dask can become a
    limitation*

These talks were structured into six sections:

1.  Workflow and pipelines
2.  Deployment
3.  Imaging
4.  General data analysis
5.  Performance and tooling
6.  Xarray

We didn't capture video, but we do have slides from each of the talks below.

Unstructured Time
-----------------

Having rapid fire talks in the morning, followed by unstructured time in the
afternoon was a productive combination that we would recommend to other broad
groups in the future.  Engagement and productivity was really high throughout
the workshop.

Above you'll see pictures from geo-scientists and quants talking about the same
challenges.  You'll also see library maintainers from Pandas/Arrow/RAPDIS/Dask
all working together on joint solutions.


Final Thoughts
--------------

Dask's strength comes from this broad community of stakeholders.

An early technical focus on simplicity and pragmatism allowed the project to be
quickly adopted within many different domains.  As a result, the practitioners
within these domains are largely the ones driving the project forward today.
This Community Driven Development brings an incredible diversity of technical
and cultural challenges and experience that force the project to quickly evolve
in a way that is constrained towards pragmatism.

There is still plenty of work to do.
Short term this workshop brought up many technical challenges that are shared
by all (simpler deployments, scheduling under task constraints, active memory
management).  Longer term we need to welcome more people into this community,
both by increasing the diversity of domains, and the diversity of individuals
(the vast majority of attendees were white men in their thirties from the US
and western Europe).

We're in a good position to effect this change.
Dask's recent growth has captured the attention of many different institutions.
Now is a critical time to be intentional about the projects growth to make sure
that the project and community continue to reflect a broad and ethical set of
principles.
