Today we're announcing the release of the [`daskhub`](https://github.com/dask/helm-chart/blob/master/daskhub/README.md) helm chart.
This is a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart to easily install [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) and Dask for multiple users
on a Kubernetes Cluster. If you're managing deployment for many people that needs interactive, scalable computing (say
for a class of students, a data science team, or a research lab) then `dask/daskhub` might be right for you. 

You can install ``dask/daskhub`` today with

```console
$ helm repo add dask https://helm.dask.org/
$ helm repo update
$ helm upgrade --install dhub dask/daskhub
```

## History

The `dask/daskhub` helm chart is an evolution of the [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/) helm chart,
which came out of that community's attempts to do big data geoscience on the cloud. We're very grateful
to have years of experience using Dask and JupyterHub together. Pangeo was always aware that there
wasn't anything geocience specific to their Helm chart and so were eager to contribute it to Dask
to share the maintenance burden.

It's interesting to read the [original announcement](https://blog.dask.org/2018/01/22/pangeo-2) of Pangeo's
JupyterHub deployment. A lot has improved, and we hope that this helm chart assists more groups
in deploying JupyterHubs capable of scalable computations with Dask.

## Details

Internally, the DaskHub helm chart is relatively simple combination of the
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) and [Dask Gateway](https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/) helm charts.
The only additional magic is some configuration to

1. Register Dask Gateway as a [JupyterHub service](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html).
2. Set environment variables to make using Dask Gateway easy for your users.

With the default configuration, your users will be able to create and connect
to Dask Clusters, including their dashboards, with a simple

```python
>>> from dask_gateway import GatewayCluster
>>> cluster = GatewayCluster()
>>> client = cluster.get_client()
```

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/kubernetes-helm.html) for details.
