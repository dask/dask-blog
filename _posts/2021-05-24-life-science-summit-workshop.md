## Executive Summary

The Dask life science workshop ran as part of the 2021 Dask Summit. Lightning talks from this workshop are [available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ0vO2F_f6OBAY6hjRHM_mIQ9yh32mWr0), and you can read on for a summary of the event.

## What is the Dask life science workshop?

The Dask life science workshop ran as part of the 2021 Dask Summit. Currently many people in life sciences use Dask, but individual groups are relatively isolated from one another. This workshop gave us an opportunity to learn from each other, as well as opportunities to identify common frustrations and areas for improvement.

The workshop involved:
* Pre-recorded lightning talks
* Interactive discussion times (accessible across timezones in Europe, Oceania, and the Americas)
* Asynchronous text chat throughout the Dask Summit

## If I missed it, how can I catch up?

If you missed the Dask Summit, you can catch up on YouTube.
There is a playlist of all the life science lightning talks [available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ0vO2F_f6OBAY6hjRHM_mIQ9yh32mWr0).

## Who came?

We invited attendees at the life science workshop to do a short Q&A about their work with Dask. This is a small subset of the people who joined us, many people came to the conference and did not do a Q&A.

The responses give us an overview of the diversity of work people in the community are doing. In no particular order, here are some of those Q&As:

**Name:** Tom White\
**Timezone:** EU/UK\
**What kind of science do you work on?** Statistical genetics\
**Something you've tried (or would like to try) with Dask?** Run per-row linear regressions at scale.\
**What do you want to do next with Dask?** Collaborative optimization of a public workflow (GWAS).\

**Name:** Isaac Virshup\
**Affiliation:** University of Melbourne. Open source projects Scanpy and AnnData
**Timezone:** AEST\
**What kind of science do you work on?** Single cell omics data.\
**Something you've tried (or would like to try) with Dask?**\
I've used dask for some nested embarrassingly parallel calculations. Having an intelligent scheduler with good monitoring made this task as easy as it should be, especially compared with multiprocessing or joblib.\
**What do you want to do next with Dask?**\
I would love to get AnnData, a container for working with single cell assays integrated with dask. Dataset sizes in this field are constantly increasing, and it would be good to be able to work with the coolest new dataset regardless of available RAM.\
Since we rely heavily on sparse arrays, a key step towards this will be getting better sparse array support (CSC and CSR especially) inside dask. After all, it's not great if our strategy for scaling out requires many times the total memory! As a maintainer, I'm interested in hearing people's experience with distributing tools that integrate well with dask.\

**Name:** Gregory R. Lee\
**Affiliation:** Quansight\
**Timezone:** EST (UTC-5)\
**What kind of science do you work on?** Scientific software development (with a background doing research in magnetic resonance imaging).\
**Something you've tried (or would like to try) with Dask?**\
In past research work, I used Dask primarily in two scenarios, both on a single workstation:
1. To achieve multi-threading by processing image blocks in parallel on the CPU (e.g. like in dask-image)
2. Serial blockwise processing of large volumetric data on the GPU (i.e. CuPy arrays of 10-100 GB in size) to reduce peak memory requirements.

**What do you want to do next with Dask?**\
Audit scikit-image functions to determine which can easily be accelerated using block-wise approaches as in dask-image. Ideally a subset of functions would work directly with dask-arrays as inputs rather than requiring users to learn about Dask's map_overlap, etc. to use this feature.\

## What's next?

Dask is now considering holding "office hours" for the life science community. If we can find enough maintainers able to host one-hour Q&A sessions, then we'll trial this for a short period of time.
