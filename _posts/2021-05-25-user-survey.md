The Dask User Survey is out again! Tell us how you use Dask, and help us make it better for everyone.

[Click this link to take the survey](https://forms.gle/F7QSGpSHwBWu8NCg8).

## Why take the survey?

Feedback from users is very important. It helps give us a clear picture who our users are and what is important to them. Your responses will inform prioritization for Dask development and improve the experience for the Dask community.

We expect the survey to take no more than 5-10 minutes.  It has the following short sections:

1.  How do you use Dask?
2.  How could Dask improve?
3.  What other tools do you use with Dask?
4.  Optional: What do you work on?


## Survey results from previous years

We will also publish answers to non-sensitive questions in our annual survey review to help keep everyone informed.
